# 📱 The Ultimate Solution: Convert to an Android App (APK)

If you want the clock to work **100% Offline**, never crash, and start automatically when the TV turns on—the best way is to turn this website into a real **Android App (.apk)**.

This removes the need for a Web Browser, Internet, or a Server. It just becomes an app installed on your TV.

### Step 1: Get the "Website 2 APK" Tool

3.  Copy this file to your **USB Drive**.
4.  Plug the USB into the TV.

## 🚀 Why is this better?
1.  **Zero Internet:** It works exactly like a Calculator or Game app. No network needed ever.
2.  **Auto-Start:** You can set it to launch when the TV turns on.
3.  **No Bars:** No address bar, no browser menus. Pure full screen.
4.  **Reliable Audio:** Audio plays natively without browser blocking issues.

This is the standard way professionals deploy digital signage in Masjids.
